Do the colors used allow a good visual contrast (ex: it is difficult to read a yellow text on a white background)?
Is the design consistent? (examples: every page follows the same palette of colors, is all centered or is it everything aligned to the right, etc.)
Is the design responsive? (when you change the width/ height of the page, is the site consistent?)
Is the interaction design good (is the interface easily usable)?
Try to explore an inexistent page.
Is the design for the 404 HTTP status covered?
